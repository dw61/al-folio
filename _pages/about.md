Hi, I'm Leo (Letao) (Diego) Wang, a MS computer science student in University of Southern California. Previously I was a software engineer at amazon. Before that I studied Computer Science at University of Virginia, where I was advised by professor [Vicente Ordóñez Román](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/).

I'm interested in the architectures of language and vision models, how different designs can improve models or limit their performances. I'm also interested in applications in psychological counseling.

I'm actively looking for research opportunities and 2025 summer internship in research / MLE / SDE. Thanks for visiting my page!
